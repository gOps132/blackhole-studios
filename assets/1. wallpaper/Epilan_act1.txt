I made this image of a city in night time to represent the romanticization of a big city.
Lot's of people romanticize moving to place where they can find opportunity a in a place they name a "city of dreams".
Where bright neon lights outshine the brightest star and the darkest alleys where the sun
can't reach.  A city where a person can live out their dreams, may be the same one that can consume them.
